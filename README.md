# Worms
The goal of the project is to create a game similar to **Worms Armageddon**, using the following libraries: SDL (for window initialization), Dear ImGui (for easier debugging and GUI management), and Box2D (for easy physics integration).<br />
We are developing this project for our university course, 'Introduction to Computer Graphics.'
