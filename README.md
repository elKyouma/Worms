# Worms
The goal of the project is to create a game similar to Worms Armageddon, using the following libraries: SDL (for window initialization), Dear ImGui (for easier debugging and GUI management), and Box2D (for easy physics integration).<br />
We are developing this project for our university course "Introduction to Computer Graphics.". The project is still a work in progress.
